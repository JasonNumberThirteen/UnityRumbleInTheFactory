## General information
- This is a "Unity" game project of my arcade game inspired by "**Battle City**", a popular top down shooter developed by [Namco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namco "Namco - Wikipedia") in 1985.
- The project presents my programming skills and how I write code taking care of several optimisations.
- The game consists of defending the nuke against incoming robots. The player controls the orange robot (player 2 controls the green one) and must shoot projectiles to destroy enemy robots which spawn on the top of the map.
- Win condition: all incoming enemy robots are destroyed
- Lose condition: the player lost all lives or the nuke is destroyed
