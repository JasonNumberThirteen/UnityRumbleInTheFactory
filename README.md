## General information
- This is a "Unity" game project of my arcade game inspired by "Battle City", a popular top down shooter developed by Namco in 1985.
- The project presents my programming skills how I do write code taking care of several optimisations.
- The game consists of defending the nuke against incoming robots. The player controls the yellow robot (player 2 controls the green one) and must shoot projectiles to destroy enemy robots which spawn on the top of the map.
- Win condition: all incoming enemy robots are destroyed
- Lose condition: the player lost all lives or the nuke is destroyed

## Used technologies
- Unity game engine (version 2022.3.1f1)
- Visual Studio Code IDE for writing code
