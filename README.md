## General information
- This is a "Unity" game project of my arcade game inspired by "**Battle City**", a popular top down shooter developed by [Namco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namco "Namco - Wikipedia") in 1985.
- The project presents my programming skills and how I write code taking care of several optimisations.
- The game consists of defending the nuke against incoming robots. The player controls the orange robot (the 2nd player controls the green one) and must shoot projectiles to destroy enemy robots which are spawned on the top of the map.
- Win condition: all incoming enemy robots are destroyed.
- Lose condition: all the players were destroyed and lost all lives or the nuke is destroyed.
- The repository contains entire [Wiki](https://github.com/JasonNumberThirteen/UnityRumbleInTheFactory/wiki) about the game explaining all the technical details.

## Usage
- W / S / A / D or arrow keys (keyboard), D-pad or left stick (gamepad) - **Navigation through menus**,
- W / S / A / D (keyboard), D-pad or left stick (gamepad) - **Movement (player 1)**,
- arrow keys, D-pad or left stick (gamepad) - **Movement (player 2)**,
- LMB (mouse), Space (keyboard), right trigger (gamepad) - **Shoot (player 1)**,
- Right Ctrl (keyboard), right trigger (gamepad) - **Shoot (player 2)**,
- Esc (keyboard), Start (gamepad) - **Pause**.

The game supports gamepad input. Connecting it to PC allows you to play the game by using a gamepad. Depending on selected game mode, input for both the players is adjusted as follows:
